On normal PonyTown I can log into my account fine, yet on the event server when I log in using my Twitter account, it acts as if it's a whole new account.<br/><br/>I wanna be able to use my customized ponies on the event server but my account won't work. Does anyone know why? [I also assume others are suffering this bug as well because I see many default ponies in the event server.]</div></div></div></body><!-- Copyrights Begin -->  <footer><font color="#00FF00" face="Consolas">Copyright &copy; 2018 "Sagiri&amp;Makigiri" All Rights reserved.</font></footer><!-- Copyrights End --></html>
